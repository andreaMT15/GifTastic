# GifTastic

**Developer: Andrea Minhas**

**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, GIPHY API, AJAX

The app is designed to make AJAX calls to the GIPHY API and dynamically load movie themed GIF's to the page. 

When the user clicks a button it will load meme's to the page along with the rating (I.E. G, PG-13). When the user clicks the image with will turn into an animated GIF version of the meme. If the user clicks the image again, the animation will stop. 


The user can also create their own button by searching for a Movie.
